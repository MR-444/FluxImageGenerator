# Installation Guide

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment isolates your project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS and Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Requirements

Install the project dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the packages listed in your `requirements.txt` file.
